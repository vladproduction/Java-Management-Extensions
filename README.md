JMX stands for Java Management Extensions. 
It's a framework designed to manage and monitor applications, resources, and services built using Java technology. It offers a standardized and flexible approach.

Key Concepts:

MBeans (Managed Beans): These are Java objects that represent the resources or entities you want to manage. They expose attributes (data), operations (actions), and notifications (events) through standardized interfaces.
JMX Agent: This is a software component that runs within your application or service. It acts as a central registry for MBeans, handling requests from clients and managing their lifecycle.
JMX Client: This is an external tool or application that interacts with the JMX Agent to access and manipulate MBeans. It can be used for monitoring, configuration, troubleshooting, or even dynamic control of your application.

Benefits of JMX:

Standardized: JMX provides a common language for applications to expose management information, regardless of platform or implementation details.
Remote Management: JMX clients can access MBeans remotely, enabling centralized management of distributed applications.
Dynamic: MBeans and their attributes can be registered and unregistered at runtime, allowing for flexible management of changing application states.

How it works:

Develop MBeans: You define MBean classes inheriting from appropriate JMX interfaces and implement the desired attributes, operations, and notifications.
Register MBeans: You register your MBeans with the JMX Agent running within your application.
JMX Client Interaction: A JMX client connects to the JMX Agent and interacts with MBeans. It can:
Read attributes: Get current values of exposed data elements.
Invoke operations: Perform actions on the managed resource.
Receive notifications: Be informed about events triggered by the MBean.

JMX is a powerful tool for managing and monitoring Java applications. While not specific to Spring, it can be integrated with Spring applications for additional functionalities and configuration options.
